# Product-Analysis-
Completed the Verifast Product Analyst Assignment! 🚀
Excited to share my latest data-driven analysis for Verifast, where I explored customer interactions with their AI-powered chatbot on an eCommerce website. The goal was to identify proactive intervention opportunities to improve engagement and boost conversions.
🔍 Key Insights from My Analysis:
✅ Cohort Analysis: Segmented users based on behavior—repeat visitors, chatbot interactions, cart abandoners—to find patterns in engagement.
✅ AI Engagement Strategies: Recommended proactive chatbot interventions, such as nudging returning users and assisting hesitant buyers.
✅ Data-Driven Experiments: Designed A/B tests to measure AI-driven nudges’ impact on conversion rates.
✅ Python & Jupyter Notebook for Analysis: Used pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and other libraries to clean data, visualize trends, and extract insights.
✅ Enhanced Data Collection Ideas: Suggested tracking additional behavioral signals like time spent on product pages and drop-off points before checkout.
This assignment reinforced the power of data-driven decision-making in product analytics. Thanks to Verifast for the engaging challenge!
